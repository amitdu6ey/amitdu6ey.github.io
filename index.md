##  About Me
I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder and a graduate student staff for the Intro to AI course.

I was previously working at Stride.ai as an NLP Engineer, where I worked on building machine learning models for tasks like Document Classification, Document Clustering, Information Extraction, etc. as well as building end to end web applications supporting these ML solutions, that include interactive visualizations and tools for providing feedback on model predictions.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Information Science and Engineering from Ramaiah Institute of Technology (2014-2018).

My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, Human Computer Interaction, Computer Science Pedagogy.
