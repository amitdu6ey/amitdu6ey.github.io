#  About me
Hi! I am Amit.

I am currently working on a Web App for Samsung PRISM to conducting surveys and create Judgement List for Search DCG Computation and Learning to Rank (LTR) Training as part of Samsung PRISM project under [Samsung R&D Institute Bangalore-India](https://www.linkedin.com/company/samsung-india/).

I am pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at [Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore](http://www.msrit.edu/) and interested in web-dev, algorithms, machine learning and its applications.
